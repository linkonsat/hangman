  def introduction
    puts "Welcome to hangman. Here is a explanation.
  In hangman your goal is to figure out the entire word
  You do this by entering a letter guess or an entire word
  You only get a certain amount of chanches to do this.
  If you get it wrong the man hanging loses a body part.
  in this version it will be a stick figure character
  if you run out of guesses you lose!
  You will also have a chance to save the game each round. GL."
